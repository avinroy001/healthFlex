Assumptions Made During Development

Timer duration input is in minutes , not seconds.
Timers are stored in localStorage , so all data persists across page reloads.
Each timer has a unique ID generated using Date.now() .
Completed timers are not removed , but marked with status "Completed".
Bulk actions only affect visible (expanded) categories .
Modal appears only once per completion and disappears when closed.
No backend is used — all data is stored locally.
Icons are taken from react-icons (specifically Font Awesome).
React state is used for managing UI logic , and localStorage handles persistent storage.
All components are client-side rendered — no SSR or API calls.

Optional Enhancements (Future Ideas)

Export timer history as JSON
Add sound notifications on completion
Support dark/light mode toggle
Track timer history and display it in a separate screen
Export Timer Data – Allow users to export timer history as a JSON file 
Custom Themes – Add support for light and dark modes with a theme switcher 
Category Filtering – Add a dropdown to filter timers by category
